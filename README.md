# Lifeguard Training App

### Description:
Desktop application developed for California State Parks to record, manage, and generate reports for their annual, statewide Lifeguard Training.
Designed to:
- seamlessly collect initial data on a year's session of trainees
- provide an environment for training operators to dynamically modify the contents of specific training sessions
- allow full control of trainee grades and comments, as well as means of recording this information
- generate numerous reports including test statistics, administrative tools, and various data summaries
- allow opertors to effortlessly swap between training sessions or between previous years' data
- reduce the time instructors and operators spend processing data and writing reports, to allow for more interaction with lifeguard trainees

#### Background:
Last summer I approached the head training instructors with the idea of making a desktop application to manage the data and reports which they were doing by hand in a google drive. Hearing how much time was being wasted on tedious tasks just screamed to me "make an app for this." I was about to start my senior year of CS at CSUF and I wanted to give back to the system which I had worked with for the greater part of a decade, while applying my skills I was learing in school. After a short meeting where I described what I could develop for them and how it would greatly reduce their time behind a computer, they quickly contracted myself to begin work. The application went into operation in June 2021.

### Process:
I followed the XP (Extreme Programming) Agile Ideology, having meetings with stakeholders once a month to show the current working version of the app and to collect feedback.
Database was designed with an Entity Relationship model, then converted to a Relational model, implemented in SQLite.
